# Paper Publication: Machine Condition Monitoring System

### Abstract

For any industry the efficiency and performance of rotating machinery/mechanical systems
is a major concern. Bearings and gears are two essential parts in a rotating machinery and any defects
in these components can lead to a major breakdown of the system thus causing large economical loss
for the company. An appropriate machine condition monitoring system is essential in such scenarios
for identifying the health of the machines. Therefore in this paper fault diagnosis of rotating mechanical
systems is performed as a feature dependent-pattern classification problem. The machine is made to run
in different good as well faulty conditions and the vibration signals are collected. Then chebfunction
coefficients are extracted from the vibration signals as part of the feature extraction process. Finally,
the extracted features are classified using regularized least squares (RLS) for identifying the good and
faulty bearing as well as gear conditions of the machine. The evaluations are performed using different
kernel functions and the average accuracy reported is 98% for bearing and gear data. The various
experiments performed claims that the proposed system can be used for real-time fault diagnosis in
rotating mechanical systems with sufficient accuracy.

Dataset: The dataset used for this project was created by our professor of Amrita school of Engineering, Coimbatore. The apparatus used for collecting the vibration signals from faults / non-faulty bearing and gear is in the college.

Algorithm: Regularized Linear Regression with different kernels
